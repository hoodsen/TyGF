a game framework made in java.
i been wanting to make my own open source project so i made this. 
hope it helps you make great games in java.

to try test this you gonna need a image named "bullet.png" in the same foler as the compiled version.

things that i think should be added:
  simple and handled networking.
  if posible better graphics handler.
  if possible better mouse and keyboard input handler.

i want this to be Object Oriented as much as it can but still need to be able to handle an awesome games.
have fun :D
